🔤 NATO Alphabet Project

This mini app converts any word you type into the NATO phonetic alphabet. 🧠📞


📚 What I Learned

* ✅ List comprehension

* ✅ Dictionary comprehension

* ✅ Reading data with Pandas

* ✅ Iterating over DataFrames


🧾 How It Works

1. The program reads a CSV file containing the NATO alphabet using pandas.

2. It creates a dictionary from the CSV where each letter is a key and its phonetic code is the value.

3. When a user types a word, each letter is converted to its NATO code using dictionary lookup and list comprehension.
